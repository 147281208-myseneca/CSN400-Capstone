ANSWERS

1 . The 'main' is where the stable version of the code runs. Whereas the 'develop' branch runs parallel to the 'main' where multiple supporting branches branch out to test new code and released into the stable version.

2.Release branch - where the already tested code in the 'develop' branch is ready to be merged into the 'main'.
   
   Feature branch - This branches out from the 'develop' but is never allowed to touch 'main'. This is where the experimental features' codes are scripted and tested.

   Hotfix branch - an emergency fix to the 'main' code created in the 'develop' and pushed quickly to 'main' before further data/information loss.


3 i. Release branch must be publicly available to all devs.
ii. Its always upto the Team Lead to merge the release code into 'main' branch with tag.
